									<h2>What Joe Biden did sounds like bribary:</h2>
									<p>With only months left in his tenure in the White House, President Barack Obama 
									strategically placed career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. 
									President Trump recalled and reassigned Yovanovitch in May, 2019. In preparation for 
									her confirmation hearing in the Senate in 2016, the Obama team provided answers 
									Yovanovitch might use if questioned about Hunter Biden’s lucrative position on the 
									board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company allegedly embroiled in government corruption.

										<h2>Brussels Panic over likely Tory Majority:</h2>
										<p>THE European Union are panicking about the risk of a Boris Johnson majority 
										following the December election - with concern in Brussels that an overwhelming 
										victory could spark a British fightback against EU demands. Brussels is wary of
										a huge Tory majority following the 12 December election, amid concerns over the 
										“strong stances” that Boris Johnson could take afterwards. The EU is preparing to 
										deal with a fired-up Boris Johnson following the vote, according to a leading 
										Brussels insider and expert, Antonio Fatas of INSEAD. The Brussels leadership are 
										aware that current polls strongly point to a huge majority for the Conservatives, 
										who are campaigning to “Get Brexit Done”.</p>

										<h2>Chile Protest still continue!:</h2>
										<p>A previous manifestation of the present turmoil occurred nearly a decade ago. 
										Thanks in large part to a new program offering government-backed student loans, 
										in 2007, 70 percent of students in Chile’s expanding higher education system were 
										the first generation of their families to reach college. It was a widely lauded 
										achievement, one more sign that Chile was a cut above the rest in its Latin American 
										neighborhood. But then a few years later, these same students began to realize that, 
										even if they did graduate, they were headed for huge student loan debts and lousy, 
										low-paid jobs, because most were unable to get into the top universities. In May 
										2011, their anger swelled into mass protest, exposing the downsides to privatized 
										education and the stark inequalities in Chilean society.</p>

										<h2>Does the DNC still deride Bernie Sanders:</h2>
										<p>Former President Barack Obama reportedly told advisers behind closed doors earlier 
										this year that he would actively oppose Sen. Bernie Sanders if the progressive senator 
										from Vermont opened up a big lead in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race.</p><p> 
										"Publicly, [Obama] has been clear that he won't intervene in the primary for or against 
										a candidate," Politico reported Tuesday. "There is one potential exception: Back when 
										Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if 
										Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him."</p>

										<h2>'Joker' continues to climb the box office:</h2>
										<p>The billion-dollar benchmark is further and further in its rearview mirror, and Joker 
										is just continuing to climb up the all-time highest-grossing list.Joker took in $2.03 
										million over the weekend in the U.S. to bring its domestic total to $326.93 million. 
										Internationally it took in $4.6 million for a new foreign total of $717 million. This 
										brings its global total to $1.048 billion off of a budget estimated between $55 and $70 
										million.This new grand total propelled it up to the 35th place on the all-time box office 
										list, up three spots from last weekend. If it can move up further is the question right 
										now. The current number 34 is the live-action Aladdin which is still playing some venues. 
										Number 33 is Rogue One: A Star Wars Story with $1.056B. Joker could surpass that this 
										week, but it totally depends on how many venues it loses.And if you were wondering, the 
										top spot this weekend went to Frozen II with $85.25 million domestically and $163 million 
										at the foreign box office for a global total of $738 million.Joker is definitely in its 
										final days, but it has a ton to be proud of in its run.</p>
