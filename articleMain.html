									<h2>Trump and Hong Kong:</h2>
									<h3>Did Trump win over Hong Kong? Why are the Hong Kong Protesters supporting Trump?</h3>
									<br>
									<p>Hundreds of people gathered at Chater Garden on Sunday afternoon to thank President 
									Donald Trump for signing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act that could lead to 
									diplomatic and economic sanctions on the city. The rally, “Thank You US,” organized by a 
									localist group called Hong Kong Autonomy Action (HKAA), saw people waving American flags 
									and marching to the U.S. Consulate in Central.

									<p>The rally, “Thank You US,” organized by a localist group called Hong Kong Autonomy 
									Action (HKAA), saw people waving American flags and marching to the U.S. Consulate in 
									Central. The rally also carried strong messages against the Communist Party of China.
									</p>
									
									<p>Last week, Trump signed into law the legislation that could impose diplomatic action 
									and economic sanctions against Hong Kong, much to the anger of China which said it constituted 
									meddling in the country’s internal affairs as it warned that it would result in consequences.
									The law will, among other things, allow Washington to suspend Hong Kong’s special trading 
									status based on an annual certification by the State Department, which will gauge whether 
									the city retains a sufficient degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework.

									<p>It will also give the U.S. discretion to sanction people deemed responsible for 
									acts that undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy from mainland China, and not block visas to 
									individuals deemed to have been subjected to political persecution. While analysts 
									have warned that the legislation could hurt Hong Kong’s standing as a financial and 
									business hub, participants at the rally shrugged off such concerns.</p>
									
									<p>A construction worker, who only gave his name as R, attended the event with his 
									girlfriend, bringing along an American flag. He acknowledged the act might adversely 
									affect Hong Kong’s relationship with mainland China, especially in areas such as commerce. 
									“But if we don’t keep a public discourse going and gain international support, those in 
									power will not change their mind,” he said. A protester surnamed Chuen said she hoped the 
									act would put economic pressure on the Hong Kong government.
									</p>

									<p>“The act might harm our economy in the short term, but ultimately it will damage China 
									more — which is what we want,” she said. A financial consultant surnamed Kwok said the 
									passing of the act might have an effect on the economy, but it would also send “an important 
									message to world leaders that we’re fighting for the right cause.”</p>
